We used publicly available data set from the Pediatric Heart Network (https://www.pediatricheartnetwork.org/public-use-data-sets/). The Collaborative Learning data set (n=322) available from this site includes variables with reasonable missingness to answer the research questions.

Access to the individual datasets as well as the individual codebooks used on this project can be found in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nEju46WGxUcpoGwxt1o80tLt_MeIVnuo).
