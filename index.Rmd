## **Research Questions:**

We will explore and visualize two research questions:

1.  On average, how long (hours) did it take to initiate the first oral feed in the ICU after extubation, and at what times of day was initiation of oral feeding most common?
2.  Was early extubation associated with shorter time to the first postoperative oral feed, and did this differ based on diagnosis (Tetralogy of Fallot or coarctation of the aorta)?

## **Data Source:**

We will use a publicly available data set from the Pediatric Heart Network (<https://www.pediatricheartnetwork.org/public-use-data-sets/>). The Collaborative Learning data set (n=322) available from this site includes variables with reasonable missingness to answer the research questions.
