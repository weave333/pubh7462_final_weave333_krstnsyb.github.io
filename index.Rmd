## Motivation

Infants undergoing cardiac surgery frequently struggle with oral feeding skills. Challenges with oral feeding are associated with negative surgical and developmental outcomes and longer hospital length of stay. Longer duration of postoperative intubation has been associated with oral feeding challenges (e.g., tube feeding at hospital discharge). 

Early extubation, defined as extubation in the operating room or within 6 hours of arrival to the ICU, could be a modifiable clinical practice target to lower the incidence of oral feeding problems in this population.

## Data Source:


We will use a publicly available data set from the Pediatric Heart Network (<https://www.pediatricheartnetwork.org/public-use-data-sets/>). The Collaborative Learning data set (n=322) available from this site includes variables with reasonable missingness to answer the research questions.

## Research Questions:


We will explore and visualize two research questions:

1.  On average, how long (hours) did it take to initiate the first oral feed in the ICU after extubation, and at what times of day was initiation of oral feeding most common?  

2.  Was early extubation associated with shorter time to the first postoperative oral feed, and did this differ based on diagnosis (Tetralogy of Fallot or coarctation of the aorta)?
