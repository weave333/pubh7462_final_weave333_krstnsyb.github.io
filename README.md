# **PUBH 7462 Final Project Proposal**

#### Kristin Elgersma, Brett Weaver

## **Project Title:** 
Relationship between early extubation after infant cardiac surgery and time to first postoperative oral feeds

## **Motivation:** 
Infants undergoing cardiac surgery frequently struggle with oral feeding skills. Challenges with oral feeding are associated with negative surgical and developmental outcomes and longer hospital length of stay. Longer duration of postoperative intubation has been associated with oral feeding challenges (e.g., tube feeding at hospital discharge). Early extubation, defined as extubation in the operating room or within 6 hours of arrival to the ICU, could be a modifiable clinical practice target to lower the incidence of oral feeding problems in this population.  

## **Research Questions:**
We will explore and visualize two research questions:
On average, how long (hours) did it take to initiate the first oral feed in the ICU after extubation, and at what times of day was initiation of oral feeding most common?
Was early extubation associated with shorter time to the first postoperative oral feed, and did this differ based on diagnosis (Tetralogy of Fallot or coarctation of the aorta)?

## **Data Source:**
We will use a publicly available data set from the Pediatric Heart Network (https://www.pediatricheartnetwork.org/public-use-data-sets/). The Collaborative Learning data set (n=322) available from this site includes variables with reasonable missingness to answer the research questions.

## **Initial Analysis Plan:**
Overall: Flexdashboard/shiny
Both RQs will be a combination of ggplot and plotly
Potential for visualizations that can be stratified by selected covariates in shiny (e.g., demographics, diagnosis, infant age, postoperative complications, clinical site)

## **Planned Team Member Contributions:**
#### **Kristin:**
* Data wrangling - will take the lead
* Will deal with missing data
* RQ 1 visualizations
* Will set up flexdashboard

#### **Brett:**
* Data wrangling - will double check work and offer alternatives
* RQ 2 visualizations
* Will take the lead on potential shiny work
* Will set up GitHub page
